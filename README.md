# haskell-type-programming
Experiments with type-level programming in Haskell,
probably mostly just using Tic Tac Toe as our extended example.

# The plan

1. Solving [Tony Morris' Tic Tac Toe Challenge](https://blog.tmorris.net/posts/understanding-practical-api-design-static-typing-and-functional-programming/),
	a. with the simplest possible type-level programming approach
        b. with the more complicated Ghosts of Departed Proofs technique / library

with more to come, hopefully
